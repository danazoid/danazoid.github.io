I learn French and Japanese. <br>
In my opinion, one's input sources should have both text and audio. <br>
Text helps decipher what is said. Audio teaches how to say it.

So I have transcribed the dubbed audio using AI. <br>
There are still some blanks and mistakes. <br>
Do let me know at ((address)) for corrections!<br>

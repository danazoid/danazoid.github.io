      <h4> Content? </h4>
<p>
I'm not sure what to put on this page yet.
I suppose one day I will be confident enough to put up recordings of myself.
Or maybe I will be able to play with a band.
Meanwhile here's some rambling:
</p>

<h3> My Music Journey </h3>

<h4> Starting music in school </h4>
<p>
In primary school, I learned to play the clarinet (Bb and bass) and saxophone (tenor). In secondary (middle) school I continued with band, playing the tenor and then the baritone saxophone.
</p>

<p>
I didn't enjoy the music we played so I wasn't very motivated and stopped before JC (high school). I made only a few attempts to transcribe what I liked. I didn't really know that I could (and should) go my own way, beyond what I had been asked to do. I had also discovered some things, but I didn't know these were proper techniques until very much later.
</p>

<h4> Saxophone as an Adult </h4>
<p>
I began to miss the saxophone while I was at university. The local Yamaha music shop would hold regular sales, and one day there was a YAS-23, which I bought for about SGD 1.1k, in 2008 I believe. It's been with me ever since, and it still plays well. I did service it for SGD 400 in 2021.
</p>

<p>
Upon graduation I took weekly lessons with a professional instructor. He corrected several mistakes and introduced new techniques, music theory, and resources. I stopped lessons after a year, as it came to a point where I wasn't making much progress, and it no longer felt worth the cost.
</p>

<p>
Over the years the internet has grown in the availability of resources, both cheap and free. Teachers and solo recordings are all a click away. Progress is so much easier than before.
</p>

<h4> Piano </h4>
<p>
In med school I started toying with piano and keyboard. I had just discovered Clair de Lune, but I could barely play the first row of the first page. There were too many notes to sight read at once.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after completing housemanship, I realized I had very little skill in general. For over 15 years I had diligently attended class and listened to instructors. But why couldn't I do anything? I was sick and tired of school and formal instruction. 
</p>

<p>
I decided to get serious and go my own way. I had devoured all of Nassim Taleb's books and was convinced the best way to learn piano was to dive headfirst into a piece. And, if I could enjoy playing rhythm games like "Guitar Hero", then I could have the same driving force.
</p>

<p>
I chose to do "Clair de Lune" as it is a piece I can listen to over and over. Also, it sounds great even when played at a slow or inconsistent tempo. Not only is this very encouraging, it impresses people who don't play piano!
